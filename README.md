## Technologies Used
<img align="left" alt="HTML5" width="26px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" /> HTML: HTML was used to structure the content of the site in an organized way, creating different sections like the header, body, and footer. This helps both visitors and search engines easily understand the content on each part of the page. As a result, the site became easier to navigate and performed better in online searches.

<img align="left" alt="CSS3" width="26px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" /> CSS: CSS was responsible for making the site look nice and pleasant. It took care of the visual aspects, such as colors, fonts, and overall style. We also made sure the site automatically adjusted to different devices, like phones and computers, to ensure a good user experience, no matter the screen size. Additionally, the use of subtle animations and transitions added a modern and interactive touch to the navigation.

<img align="left" alt="JavaScript" width="26px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" /> JavaScript: JavaScript was used to make the site more dynamic. It helped create interesting interactions, such as menus that open when clicked and a testimonial carousel that moves automatically. It also ensured that, when filling out a form, the user would receive a warning message if the email entered was incorrect, preventing errors.

<img align="left" alt="Figma" width="26px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/figma/figma-original.svg" /> Figma: Figma was the design tool used to plan how the site should look visually. It helped create the initial mockup and was very useful in ensuring that the site was easy to use and enjoyable to navigate. The design and development teams worked together to ensure everything was delivered consistently, according to the original visual plan.
